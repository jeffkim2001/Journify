# Journify
Journify is your must-have augmented reality journal app. Users can enter journal entries with explanations of what the experience was, their reaction or details of the experience, and an image depicting the experience in real space and time. Each message bubble that contains the journal entry remains in the location where the user originally posted the entry regardless of the user's position. The app was built and tested within 24 hours at HSHacks IV.
